# Jerry, the AI Mouse: Development Proposal

## Introduction  
"Jerry, the AI Mouse" is a proposed lightweight simulator for developing and evaluating a biologically inspired AI memory system. The project draws inspiration from the hippocampal architecture of the brain and **prospective reinforcement-based learning**, aiming to create an agent (Jerry the mouse) that learns from experience, forms associative memories, and uses those memories to plan future actions. The simulator will provide a simple, modular environment where Jerry can be trained on basic tasks (like navigating mazes or learning cues) with a memory-enhanced reinforcement learning model. Importantly, this platform is designed to run on low-end PCs and to foster community contributions, serving as a foundation for more complex scenarios (eventually including a cat adversary "Tom") and more sophisticated cognitive experiments.

## Objectives and Key Features  
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the simulator runs smoothly on modest hardware (integrated graphics, low RAM) so that hobbyists and students can use it. Minimal external dependencies and an easy setup (ideally cross-platform and possibly browser-based via WebGL) will lower the barrier to entry.  
- **Core Learning Tasks:** Implement basic yet meaningful learning tasks for Jerry, such as maze navigation, cue-reward association, and trap avoidance. These tasks will demonstrate how a reinforcement learning agent with an associative memory can learn **spatial routes, predictive cues, and danger locations** through trial and error.  
- **Biologically Inspired Memory:** Use a **reinforcement-enhanced associative memory model** inspired by the hippocampus. Jerry’s AI brain will rapidly form associations (like the hippocampus does for episodic memory) and reinforce the ones that lead to rewards ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=CA1%20selectively%20reinforces%20high,value%20sequences.%20Figure)). This will enable **imagination and planning** – the agent can internally replay or simulate trajectories and outcomes, strengthening useful memories (analogous to how the brain’s CA3 region generates possible paths and CA1 evaluates their value ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=unexperienced%20%28novel%29%20sequences,value%20sequences.%20Figure))).  
- **Modular & Expandable Design:** Architect the simulator in a modular way with clearly separated components (environment, memory engine, trainer, etc.). This will make it easy to extend – for example, adding a more complex character like *Tom the Cat* as an adversary, or adding multi-agent scenarios, new game mechanics, and advanced tasks (social learning, competition) without rewriting the core.  
- **Visualization Tools:** Provide built-in tools to visualize Jerry’s memory structure and learning process. For example, display Jerry’s internal memory map or associative network, highlight the flow of the reward signal through the system, and plot learning progress over time. These visual aids will help developers and researchers **observe how and what the agent is learning**, making the system more interpretable.  
- **Open-Source Community Development:** Use open-source-friendly technologies and an accessible codebase to encourage community contributions. The project will start with a basic prototype and include documentation, example extensions, and contribution guidelines. Developers can add new environments, plug in different memory models, or improve the interface, steadily evolving the simulator into a richer platform.

## Core Simulator Architecture and Modules  
To achieve the above goals, "Jerry, the AI Mouse" is organized into core modules that interact in a training loop. The architecture separates concerns of simulation, learning, memory, and visualization, allowing each part to be developed and extended independently. The primary modules are:

- **Environment Module:** This module simulates the world in which Jerry operates. It includes the layout of the space (e.g. maze walls, corridors), objects like rewards (cheese) or hazards (traps), and possibly other entities. The environment provides observations to the agent (Jerry) at each time step – for instance, the agent’s current location, sensory cues, or nearby objects. It also applies the agent’s actions to update the state (moving Jerry, triggering a trap, etc.), enforcing the physics or rules of the world. Environments are designed to be easily swapped or modified: one can load a different maze or scenario without changing other parts of the system.  

- **Memory Engine (Associative Memory and Decision System):** This is the “brain” of Jerry – an AI memory system inspired by the hippocampus and associated brain regions. It stores and recalls associations from Jerry’s experiences and interacts with the reinforcement learning algorithm to guide decisions. The memory engine is responsible for encoding episodes (sequences of states, actions, outcomes) into a memory structure, such as an associative graph or a neural network with memory cells. Crucially, it uses reinforcement signals to strengthen useful memories: when Jerry gets a reward, the pathways in memory leading to that reward are prioritized and consolidated ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=CA1%20selectively%20reinforces%20high,value%20sequences.%20Figure)). Conversely, if a route led to a bad outcome (negative reward), the memory engine can adjust to avoid that in the future. This mechanism is analogous to how the hippocampus might replay various possible trajectories and reinforce those that lead to success ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=unexperienced%20%28novel%29%20sequences,value%20sequences.%20Figure)). The memory engine will likely combine two functions: (1) **Simulation/Replay** – generating possible next steps or recalling similar past situations to evaluate options (much like hippocampal replay/imagination of future paths), and (2) **Selection/Policy** – choosing the action that maximizes expected reward, given both the current state and the memory of past outcomes. Initially, the memory engine could be a simple associative table or neural network (e.g. a Q-learning table with states augmented by memory of visited locations). Later, it can be expanded into a more complex architecture (for example, a network with recurrent layers or a differentiable memory bank) as long as it adheres to the same interface. This modular design means researchers can plug in a new memory model (say a different hippocampal-inspired algorithm) to test in Jerry’s environment without changing the rest of the code.

- **Trainer Module:** The trainer orchestrates the learning process. It runs episodes of interaction between Jerry (memory engine) and the environment, applying a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve Jerry’s performance over time. The trainer handles the loop of **Reset -> Run step -> Collect reward -> Update**, as follows: it resets the environment at the start of an episode, initializes or resets Jerry’s memory if needed, then repeatedly feeds the current state to the memory engine and obtains an action, applies the action to the environment, retrieves the reward (and next state) from the environment, and finally updates the memory engine’s parameters using the reward feedback (this could involve backpropagating through a neural network, updating Q-values, or strengthening/weakening certain memory associations). The trainer also decides when an episode ends (e.g., when Jerry finds the cheese or falls into a trap, or after a time limit) and can adjust training hyperparameters. Essentially, this module implements the chosen reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning, policy gradients, Dyna-Q, etc.) on top of the memory engine and environment dynamics. By isolating the training logic here, one can swap different RL algorithms or training strategies (e.g., with or without experience replay, with curiosity bonuses, etc.) without altering the environment or memory modules.

- **Reward Engine:** The reward engine defines the reinforcement signal (reward/punishment) logic for the tasks. While the environment module might handle the raw mechanics (e.g., placing cheese or triggering a trap), the reward engine translates those events into numerical reward values for learning. This separation allows flexible reward shaping and easy tuning of reward functions. For example, the reward engine can specify that reaching the cheese yields +1 reward, each step costs -0.01 (to encourage efficiency), and falling into a trap yields -1. It can also manage more complex reinforcement signals, like partial rewards for intermediate goals or penalties for specific behaviors. In a modular design, the environment might report an event ("cheese found" or "trap triggered") to the reward engine, which then returns the corresponding reward value to the trainer. This way, changing how rewards are computed (say, giving a bigger reward for faster completion) doesn’t require altering the environment mechanics or the learning algorithm. The reward engine can also be extended to multi-agent scenarios – for instance, handling competitive rewards (if Tom the cat catches Jerry, maybe Tom gets a reward while Jerry gets a penalty).

- **GUI and Visualization Interface:** A crucial feature of this simulator is an interactive interface that not only displays the environment (so we can watch Jerry move through a maze in real-time) but also reveals internal aspects of Jerry’s learning process. The GUI will render the environment’s layout (walls, cheese, traps, Jerry’s position, etc.) in either 2D or simple 3D. It will also include overlays or separate panels for visualizations: for example, a **memory graph view** showing nodes and connections that represent memory fragments (with highlights on recently activated memories or strengthened associations), and a **reward signal view** indicating the flow of reward or value (perhaps a real-time plot of Jerry’s cumulative reward, or a heatmap of value estimates in different areas of the maze). Additionally, the GUI can show Jerry’s learning progress across episodes – e.g., a chart of the number of steps to reach the goal over time, or success rate after each training session. Developers will be able to pause the simulation, step through it frame by frame, and inspect the agent’s memory contents at any point. For debugging or educational purposes, one could click on a location in the maze and see if Jerry has a memory of that location (and what reward was associated with it). By making the internals visible, the simulator serves as a teaching tool for how reinforcement learning and memory interact. The GUI should remain lightweight: it might be a simple window with 2D graphics or a web-based interface. The use of minimalistic graphics (simple shapes for the maze and icons for Jerry and objects) will keep performance high even on basic computers.

Each of these modules communicates through well-defined interfaces. For example, the memory engine will have functions like `choose_action(state)` for the environment to query, and `update_memory(state, action, reward, next_state)` for the trainer to call after each step. The environment will have methods to initialize (`reset()`) and to accept an action (`step(action)`) and return observations and events. This decoupling ensures that improvements or changes in one module (say, a new memory algorithm, or a new visualization feature) do not ripple unpredictably through the system. It also means multiple people can work on different modules in parallel – a community member could build a new maze environment while another experiments with a new training algorithm, and both should integrate smoothly if they follow the module interface contracts.

## Example Environments and Tasks  
To demonstrate Jerry’s learning capabilities, the simulator will include several example environments and tasks from the start. These tasks are chosen to be **simple enough for a prototype** but rich enough to require memory and learning, thereby showcasing the strengths of a hippocampal-inspired approach. Below are some initial scenarios:

- **Maze Navigation:** Jerry is placed in a maze and must find a piece of cheese located at a goal position. This classic task tests spatial memory and exploration. Initially, Jerry will wander randomly, bumping into dead-ends. Over time, using its memory, Jerry should learn the layout (forming an internal “cognitive map” of the maze) and remember the correct route to the cheese. We can start with a small grid maze and increase complexity as Jerry improves. *Success criterion:* Jerry learns to reach the cheese consistently and more efficiently (fewer wrong turns) after repeated trials. *Relevance to memory model:* Hippocampal place-memory is crucial here – Jerry’s memory engine will associate certain landmarks or junctions with directions that lead to the goal. We might even simulate *place cells* firing in the visualization to show how Jerry knows “where it is” in the maze ([Insights into AI algorithms drawn from hippocampal function | The Center for Brains, Minds & Machines](https://cbmm.mit.edu/video/insights-ai-algorithms-drawn-hippocampal-function#:~:text=really%20critical%20for%20the%20formation,you%20embed%20priors%20into%20your)).  

- **Cue-Reward Association:** In this task, an environmental cue (e.g., a specific sound, light flash, or visual marker) predicts a reward appearing in a certain location. For example, a tone sounds and then a food pellet appears on the left or right side of an arena; a different tone predicts the opposite side. Jerry must learn the association between the cue and the reward location, and move to the correct spot when the cue is heard. This is analogous to classical Pavlovian conditioning experiments where animals learn that a neutral stimulus predicts a reward ([The_role_of_prospective_contingency_in_the_control.pdf](file://file-UvzkUBoexpXrwBncEZJaC4#:~:text=contingencies%2C%20all%20animals%20developed%20anticipatory,109)). *Success criterion:* After training, Jerry runs toward the correct location as soon as the cue plays, indicating it has formed a memory link between that cue and the reward. *Memory model relevance:* The associative memory will store the correlation between the cue and the outcome (reward on a side). The memory engine might implement this by linking a “cue” representation to a “place” or “action” representation, strengthened by the reward signal. Over trials, the cue will evoke the memory of the rewarded location, demonstrating prospective recall (Jerry expects the reward due to memory). This task can be extended to multiple cues or probabilistic cues (sometimes a cue doesn’t give a reward) to test Jerry’s ability to learn contingencies and probabilities, similar to how real mice adjust their behavior when a cue’s reliability changes ([The_role_of_prospective_contingency_in_the_control.pdf](file://file-UvzkUBoexpXrwBncEZJaC4#:~:text=contingencies%2C%20all%20animals%20developed%20anticipatory,109)).

- **Trap Avoidance:** Jerry’s environment contains a hidden trap or a zone that triggers a negative event (e.g., a mild “shock” or a cat pouncing sound) that gives a negative reward (punishment). The first time, Jerry won’t know about it and might step on it, receiving a bad outcome. The task is for Jerry to remember that location or trigger and avoid it in the future while still trying to reach some goal or find food. For instance, a maze might have a shortcut to the cheese that passes over a trap; Jerry should learn to take a longer route instead of the dangerous shortcut. *Success criterion:* Jerry learns to minimize entering the trap area after a few experiences, showing avoidance behavior. *Memory model:* The memory engine will associate that specific location or context with a negative outcome, and thus when a similar situation arises, the decision policy will favor alternative paths. This tests the **punishment side of reinforcement learning** and whether the memory can store and recall not just positive reward locations but also “bad memories” to steer away from. Visualization could show the remembered “danger zones” in the environment (perhaps highlighted in red on the map once Jerry has discovered them).

- **Baseline Reflexes (for comparison):** As a control scenario, we might also include a very simple task or reflex test to demonstrate Jerry’s base behavior. For example, an open field with a single piece of cheese in plain sight – Jerry doesn’t need memory here, only a simple stimulus-response (smell or sight of cheese -> go to it). This highlights the difference when memory is needed versus when it’s not. It can also serve as a sanity check that the reinforcement learning loop works in a trivial case.

The simulator can load each of these tasks as separate levels or modes. Community contributors might design additional tasks, such as a **radial arm maze** (commonly used in lab experiments for memory, where multiple arms radiate out and the mouse must remember which arms it has already gotten food from) or **open-field foraging** (multiple randomly placed rewards that appear and disappear, testing working memory and exploration).

 ([File:Help the mouse find the cheese maze.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Help_the_mouse_find_the_cheese_maze.svg#:~:text=Description%20Help%20the%20mouse%20find,svg)) ([File:Help the mouse find the cheese maze.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Help_the_mouse_find_the_cheese_maze.svg#:~:text=Image%3A%20Creative%20Commons%C2%A0Image%3A%20CC,their%20rights%20to%20the%20work))For example, a simple maze puzzle can serve as an initial environment, where Jerry has to find the cheese through trial and error. In the illustration below, the mouse starts at the top and the cheese (reward) is at the bottom of the maze ([File:Help the mouse find the cheese maze.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Help_the_mouse_find_the_cheese_maze.svg#:~:text=Description%20Help%20the%20mouse%20find,svg)). Jerry’s memory-enhanced brain will enable it to gradually remember the correct turns in the maze. Over successive runs, Jerry should get faster at finding the reward, as its memory engine consolidates the high-value path and avoids the dead ends or loops where no reward was found. This task visually demonstrates spatial learning – akin to a **cognitive map** being formed within Jerry’s memory – and provides a baseline scenario to verify that the simulator’s learning cycle is functioning correctly.

This simulation-selection model ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=2018%29,future%20decisions%20in%20similar%20contexts)) guides the design of Jerry’s associative memory engine, allowing it to generate possible routes and preferentially remember the successful ones.]( ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full)))

*Figure: Illustration of a hippocampal-inspired memory process.* The diagram shows how a hippocampal model (from neuroscience research) generates and evaluates trajectories: in (A) an agent explores paths where one leads to a reward (cheese) and others do not; in (B) the CA3 region replays various experienced (solid lines) and novel (dashed lines) sequences of actions, and in (C) the CA1 region selectively strengthens those sequences that yielded a reward ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=Figure%201,of%20synapses%20for%20each%20projection)). Applying this idea, Jerry’s memory engine will simulate possible actions (even those not tried yet) and use the reward feedback to solidify the beneficial action sequences. This mechanism is similar to the **Dyna-Q** algorithm in reinforcement learning, where an agent performs offline mental simulations to speed up learning ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=valuation%20processes,derived%20from%20limited%20experiences%2C%20rather)). By having such a module, our simulator will allow Jerry to *plan* in the maze (by thinking ahead about potential paths) and learn much faster from limited real experience, mirroring the way real rodents use hippocampal replay for navigation planning.

## Modularity and Future Expansion  
One of the key requirements is that the simulator be modular and extensible. The core design described above allows adding new features or agents with minimal changes to the existing code. We plan the following expansions to demonstrate and test the modularity:

- **Introducing “Tom the Cat” (Adversarial Agent):** A future module will add Tom, an adversarial agent that introduces a predator-prey dynamic. Tom could be a simple rule-based agent at first (e.g., it patrols or chases Jerry when in sight) or another learning agent. The environment would then become a two-agent arena, where Jerry must not only find rewards but also avoid being caught by Tom. This requires multi-agent support in the environment (two entities moving and possibly interacting). Thanks to modular design, we can give Tom his own decision module (which could be a simplified version of Jerry’s brain or a different algorithm entirely) without altering Jerry’s memory engine. The reward engine can handle competitive rewards: for instance, if Tom catches Jerry, Jerry gets a large negative reward (and the episode ends), whereas Tom’s agent, if implemented, might get a positive reward. *Why it’s useful:* This adversarial setup brings in **social and competitive learning** aspects – Jerry might learn to anticipate the predator’s behavior (a form of social memory), and the memory system might need to generalize from purely reward-based learning to also include safety and opponent modeling. It also makes the tasks more game-like and engaging for users, encouraging community contributions to improve the cat-and-mouse logic.

- **Multi-Agent Interaction and Social Learning:** Beyond a single cat-and-mouse scenario, the simulator could be extended to support multiple Jerries (cooperative multi-agent) or multiple cats (or other characters). For example, two mice could work together to obtain a reward that one mouse alone can’t reach (maybe one has to press a lever while the other grabs the cheese). This tests **social learning** and communication – can Jerry’s memory system learn not just from its own experience but by observing a partner? We might include a mechanism where one agent’s actions can be fed into another’s memory (to simulate observational learning or teaching). The environment module would manage multiple agents, and the trainer might use multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (like self-play or centralized training with decentralized execution). The modular approach means each agent can be an instance of an agent class with its own memory engine, and the environment can iterate through each agent’s action each timestep. Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a growing field, and the simulator could provide a simplified testbed for those ideas in a biologically-inspired context. (Notably, massive multi-agent environments exist in research, such as OpenAI’s *Neural MMO* which has many agents in a persistent world ([15 awesome reinforcement learning environments you must know](https://medium.com/@mlblogging.k/15-awesome-reinforcement-learning-environments-you-must-know-a38fb75867f2#:~:text=15%20awesome%20reinforcement%20learning%20environments,multi%20agent%20reinforcement%20learning%20methods)), but our focus is on keeping scenarios tractable and interpretable, gradually increasing complexity.)

- **Additional Tasks and Scenarios:** Community contributors will be encouraged to add new environments. The modular design allows creation of new `Environment` subclasses to implement different puzzles or games. Some ideas for future tasks include: **Hide-and-Seek**, where Jerry must hide from Tom using obstacles (requiring memory of safe hiding spots); **Sequential Puzzles**, where Jerry has to gather items in order (testing memory of task rules or sequences); **Navigation with Landmarks**, where specific landmarks cue where the cheese is hidden on that day (testing flexible memory and context dependency); or even **Maze with Moving Elements**, where parts of the maze change, forcing Jerry to continually update its memory (testing memory updating and forgetting). Because the memory engine and trainer are decoupled from the environment, these new tasks can be plugged in easily – the same learning algorithm can then be evaluated on how well it adapts to different challenges, which is useful for research.  

- **Scalability Considerations:** Although initially the simulator will use simple 2D worlds, the architecture won’t preclude scaling up to richer simulations. For example, one could later swap the 2D maze environment with a lightweight 3D environment (imagine a 3D maze or a small room modeled in a game engine) to explore how Jerry’s algorithms handle more realistic sensory input. The memory system could also be scaled or swapped out for more sophisticated ones (like a deep neural network with external memory components, or a spiking neural network model of hippocampus, etc.), as long as they implement the expected interface. This way, *Jerry, the AI Mouse* can evolve from a simple prototype into a general testbed for various AI and cognitive science experiments. The codebase will be structured to accommodate these extensions (for example, configuration files or plugin systems to load different modules at startup).

In summary, the simulator’s modular design is meant to future-proof it: new agents (predators, companions), new tasks, and even new learning algorithms should integrate without a full rewrite. We will document the interfaces and provide examples to make it as straightforward as possible for the community to contribute expansions. By planning for these future possibilities from the start, we ensure that the initial architecture choices (like separating memory and environment) facilitate, rather than hinder, growth into a more complex platform. 

## Visualization Tools for Memory and Learning  
A standout feature of this project is the suite of visualization tools included with the GUI. These tools will help users and developers to *peer inside* Jerry’s mind and the learning process. They not only make the simulator educational but also aid in debugging and validating that the memory system is working as intended. Key visualization components include:

- **Memory Structure Viewer:** This panel graphically represents the contents of Jerry’s associative memory. For a simple implementation, this could be a graph where nodes represent states or cues (e.g., a node for a particular maze location or a sensory cue) and edges represent learned associations or transitions (e.g., "from location X go to Y to get reward"). The edges or nodes could be colored or sized according to their “value” or usage frequency (so the path to cheese lights up brighter after learning). If the memory is a neural network, we might visualize activation patterns or weights (perhaps showing which neurons encode which places or cues). During runtime, as Jerry experiences events, the memory viewer can update – e.g., when Jerry gets a reward, we might briefly highlight the sequence of states that led to it, indicating “this sequence is being reinforced in memory.” This directly illustrates the concept of **memory consolidation**, where rewarding experiences become strengthened. Advanced options might allow pausing the simulation and inspecting memory: for instance, querying “what does Jerry remember about this cue?” could highlight the associated reward location in the maze.

- **Reinforcement Signal Trace:** This visualization shows the flow of reward and how it influences learning. One implementation is a real-time graph of the reward received versus time (episode timeline) or a cumulative reward per episode. Another is a display of the temporal difference error or confidence level in Jerry’s choices. For example, when Jerry takes an action expecting a certain outcome and reality differs, the spike of surprise (error) could be shown. This is analogous to dopamine reward prediction error in animal learning ([The_role_of_prospective_contingency_in_the_control.pdf](file://file-UvzkUBoexpXrwBncEZJaC4#:~:text=contingencies%2C%20all%20animals%20developed%20anticipatory,109)), which could be a teaching moment for users to connect biology and AI. If Jerry’s algorithm uses something like Q-values for state-action pairs, the GUI might allow clicking on a location to see the values of different actions from that state (perhaps represented as arrows with strengths). Over training, one should see the values converge to reflect the optimal path. This component helps verify that the reinforcement learning algorithm is properly updating the value estimates and that the memory engine is contributing (e.g., if memory makes planning more effective, we might see faster value changes).

- **Performance and Progress Charts:** To summarize learning progress, the interface will include charts updated every episode. Typical examples are: episode vs. steps taken to reach goal, episode vs. reward obtained, or success rate out of the last N trials. We might also show moving averages to smooth the curves. In the maze example, one would expect to see a downward trend in steps taken as Jerry learns the maze. In the trap avoidance example, a chart could show the frequency of stepping on the trap over time, which should decrease. These metrics give quantitative feedback that the agent is improving, complementing the more qualitative visual feedback from watching the agent act. The charts can be simple using a plotting library or custom drawing on the canvas. The key is to update them live, so users get an immediate sense of how changes in the setup (or in Jerry’s brain parameters) affect learning.

- **Interactive Controls and Debugging:** The GUI will have controls to manipulate the simulation speed (run in fast-forward for training, or slow-motion to observe decision-making), pause and step, and reset scenarios. It will also provide debugging info like the current episode number, current step number, and possibly console logs of significant events (e.g., “Jerry found cheese! Memory strengthened.” or “Jerry triggered trap. Updating avoidance memory.”). For developers testing new memory algorithms, we could include a developer console or the ability to run custom code at a pause (for example, to manually probe the memory data structures). While not strictly visualization, these tools ensure the simulator is not a black box, but an open laboratory for experimentation.

The visualization aspect will be implemented with performance in mind – for example, heavy rendering of network graphs will be optional or updated at intervals so as not to slow down the core simulation too much. We may allow toggling layers of visualization (maybe a checkbox to turn on/off the memory overlay or live charts). The initial prototype might start with relatively simple visuals (text-based or very minimal graphics) and gradually evolve these tools as the project grows. Ultimately, by making the inner workings transparent, **Jerry, the AI Mouse** will not only be a training environment but also an educational demonstration of how memory-based reinforcement learning works.

## Recommended Technology Stack  
We propose using an open-source and cross-platform technology stack that aligns with the goals of lightweight performance and community development. The following choices are recommended for the prototype:

- **Programming Language – Python:** Python is favored for the core logic (especially the trainer and memory engine) due to its simplicity and the vast ecosystem of libraries for machine learning and simulation. Python’s readability will make it easier for new contributors to understand and modify the code. Moreover, there are many existing reinforcement learning resources and libraries (such as OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium interfaces, RLlib, Stable Baselines, etc.) that could be leveraged or serve as inspiration ([Policy Gradient with gym-MiniGrid | Chan`s Jupyter](https://goodboychan.github.io/python/pytorch/reinforcement_learning/2020/08/06/03-Policy-Gradient-With-Gym-MiniGrid.html#:~:text=Gridworld%20is%20widely%20used%20in,to%20install%20both%20of%20them)). We might implement the initial algorithms from scratch for clarity, but Python allows dropping in well-tested components if needed. Performance-wise, Python is sufficient for managing a simulation with a relatively small state space (like a maze). If we find bottlenecks (e.g., if someone runs millions of steps), we can optimize critical parts using libraries like NumPy (for vectorized operations) or even C++ extensions, but keeping things simple is a priority early on.

- **Game Engine / Rendering – Godot (or Similar):** For the environment visualization and GUI, the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is an excellent choice. Godot is a free, open-source 2D/3D game engine under the MIT license, known for its lightweight footprint and ability to export to all major platforms ([What is Godot Engine? - Medium](https://medium.com/@averageguymedianow/what-is-godot-engine-0eac30214bf2#:~:text=What%20is%20Godot%20Engine%3F%20,and%20Ariel%20Manzur%20in%202007)). It has a built-in scripting language (GDScript) which is very Python-like, lowering the learning curve for Python developers. Using Godot, we can design the maze and environment scenes graphically and control the simulation loop either via Godot scripts or by interfacing with Python (Godot has options for native plugins or communicating via sockets). Given Godot’s efficiency, it can handle simple graphics easily on low-end machines and even render to WebGL for a browser-based demo. There are precedents for using Godot in AI simulations, and its node-based scene system would let us organize the environment and GUI elements intuitively. If not Godot, another lightweight option is **Pygame** (pure Python, good for 2D graphics) – Pygame could be used to draw grid worlds and handle input, though it’s less sophisticated than Godot for complex UI. **Unity (with a lightweight approach)** is an alternative mentioned (Unity is powerful and has ML-Agents for integration with RL, but it’s heavier and not open-source). We interpret "Unity-lite" as possibly using Unity in a minimal way (e.g., simple 2D scenes, no complex lighting or physics) to maintain performance, or using a smaller framework inspired by Unity’s workflow. However, since Unity isn’t open-source, if community collaboration is a priority, Godot stands out as the more transparent choice. We’ll encourage using Godot for those contributions that involve new interactive environments or visualizations, while ensuring that core logic can still run headless (without graphics) for faster training when needed.

- **Web Technology – WebGL/HTML5:** To reach a wider audience (including educators who might want to use this in a classroom), we aim to make the simulator accessible via a web browser. Technologies like WebGL or WebAssembly can enable this. One strategy is to use Godot’s HTML5 export to compile the simulator into a WebGL application that can run in-browser, meaning someone could go to a website and see the Jerry simulator running without installing anything. Alternatively, if the core is in Python, tools like Pyodide or Brython could potentially run Python in the browser, though that is more experimental. Another approach is to reimplement the visualization in JavaScript (for example, have the Python backend computing the simulation, and a JS frontend drawing the maze and graphs on a webpage via Canvas or Three.js). Initially, the focus is on desktop (to get things working), but designing with web-compatibility in mind is good (for example, avoid heavy native dependencies, and possibly structure the code so the environment can be decoupled from display – allowing a headless mode that could pipe states to a web UI). Using web tech also aligns with being lightweight, since anything that can run in a browser is by nature limited to fairly efficient code.

- **Data and Configuration – JSON/YAML and Scripts:** The simulator will use simple data formats for configuration to remain accessible. For example, maze layouts could be described in a text file (e.g., a grid of ASCII characters, or a JSON map with walls and reward locations). This allows easy editing of levels without needing to recompile or deeply understand the code. Hyperparameters for training (learning rate, exploration rate, etc.) can also live in a config file or be adjustable via the UI. By keeping these easily editable, we lower the barrier for users to experiment with different setups or contribute new scenarios.

- **Version Control and Testing – GitHub:** The project will be managed on a public GitHub repository, which provides issue tracking, wiki pages for documentation, and forks/pull requests for contributions. We will set up basic automated tests for core logic (like ensuring the memory update works in simple known cases, or the environment resets correctly) – using Python’s unittest or PyTest for the logic, and perhaps some integration tests for one episode run. Continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) can run these tests on new contributions to catch breaking changes early. Testing the visual components might be trickier, but we can have at least a headless mode test to ensure the training loop doesn’t crash.

- **Open-Source License:** We plan to use a permissive license such as MIT or Apache 2.0 for the code. This encourages usage in both academic and hobby contexts, and allows people to build on it even in commercial or other projects if they wish. For content like images or levels, we will also ensure they are under open licenses (for example, using CC0 or CC-BY assets, like the maze graphic we included ([File:Help the mouse find the cheese maze.svg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Help_the_mouse_find_the_cheese_maze.svg#:~:text=Image%3A%20Creative%20Commons%C2%A0Image%3A%20CC,their%20rights%20to%20the%20work))). A clear license and contribution agreement will be in place so that all community contributions are also open and compatible.

In summary, the tech stack centers on Python for brain and training logic, and a lightweight game engine (preferably Godot) or library for visualization. This combination leverages Python’s strength in AI with the real-time interactivity of a game engine. By sticking to open-source tools, we ensure anyone can inspect and modify every aspect of the simulator, and we avoid any costly software requirements. Cross-platform capability is naturally addressed by these choices (Python and Godot both run on Windows, Linux, Mac, and can target web and mobile if needed). As the project evolves, we will remain open to integrating other technologies as plugins – for example, if someone wants to use a PyTorch neural network for the memory engine, that can be added; or if someone wants to visualize data with MATLAB or Unity, they could interface through files or networking. The core decisions are made to keep the entry bar low and the flexibility high.

## Open-Source Scaffolding and Community Involvement  
From the outset, *Jerry, the AI Mouse* will be structured to welcome and grow a community of contributors. Beyond the technical architecture, this involves setting up the project infrastructure and culture:

- **Project Repository and Structure:** The repository will be organized into clear folders such as `/env` (environment definitions), `/agents` (Jerry’s memory engine implementations), `/tasks` (specific task configurations), `/gui` (UI scripts or scenes), and `/docs` for documentation. A new contributor should be able to navigate and find where to add or modify things. We will include a detailed README explaining the purpose of each module and how to run the simulator. Additionally, example configuration files and maybe a few command-line scripts (e.g., `run_maze.py` to launch the maze demo quickly) will be provided to make trying it out simple.

- **Documentation and Tutorials:** Alongside in-code comments, we will maintain a wiki or docs folder for more extensive documentation. This will cover: how the core modules work, how to create a new environment (with a step-by-step guide, perhaps creating a simple “open field” as a tutorial example), how to tweak the memory model or plug in a new one, and how to add a new visualization or metric. We’ll also document the biology inspiration in accessible terms, so developers know *why* the memory system is designed a certain way. This can spark interest from people in neuroscience or reinforcement learning who may want to contribute their ideas (for example, someone might try implementing a **temporal difference learning algorithm with hippocampal replay** as described in research ([Frontiers | Memory consolidation from a reinforcement learning perspective](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1538741/full#:~:text=valuation%20processes,From%20this%20perspective%2C%20memory)), and the documentation should guide them on where such an algorithm hooks into our framework).

- **Contribution Guidelines:** We will write a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that lays out how to file issues, make pull requests, code style guidelines, and testing requirements. The tone will be encouraging – making clear that even beginner-level contributions (like fixing a typo in docs or creating a new maze design) are welcome. We’ll label beginner-friendly issues to help new contributors start. The modular nature means someone could contribute a single new environment file or a new reward schedule without touching the rest of the system, making it easier to contribute piecemeal. We will also encourage discussions via GitHub Discussions or a Discord server where people can brainstorm new ideas (like proposing a new task or memory feature and collaborating on it).

- **Community Showcase and Feedback:** As people contribute, we can highlight their additions – e.g., a “community tasks” folder for user-contributed environments or a gallery in the documentation of interesting behaviors or strategies discovered. For instance, if a contributor implements the Tom the Cat adversary, we could feature a short demo GIF of it in action, crediting them. This recognizes contributors and motivates others. We also plan to solicit feedback: since this is a novel combination of ideas (biological memory systems with AI training), community members might have valuable suggestions on improving realism or performance. Regularly opening issues or polls like “What feature should we prioritize next?” can engage the community in the roadmap.

- **Integration with Research and Education:** We anticipate interest from academic circles, so we’ll keep the project citable (e.g., we might archive versions on Zenodo or ensure the license allows use in research). If there are relevant publications (like demonstrating Jerry’s memory system achieving something notable), we can reference those in the project to build credibility. Conversely, we will stay attentive to new research that could be incorporated. For example, if a new paper comes out about a better way to model hippocampal replay, a community member or one of us could try to implement that in Jerry’s framework. This creates a virtuous cycle where the simulator acts as a bridge between theory and practice. Educators might use Jerry in classrooms to show students how an AI can learn; to support this, we’ll try to keep the interface intuitive and possibly provide a simplified mode or pre-run results so that even without coding, one can use the simulator for demonstration.

- **Maintaining Lightweight Performance:** As contributions pour in, there is a risk of bloat (too many features could slow it down or complicate it). We’ll enforce that optional features are toggled off by default, and core scenarios remain efficient. For instance, if someone adds a very complex 3D environment that needs heavy resources, we might include it as an optional download or plugin, rather than in the main loop for all users. Continuous integration can also help catch when performance degrades – we can have a simple benchmark test (like run 1000 steps of the base maze and ensure it completes under a certain time). This way, we honor the commitment to low-end PC compatibility while still allowing growth.

The open-source scaffolding is as important as the code itself for a sustainable project. By clearly defining architecture, providing documentation, and fostering a friendly community space, we hope "Jerry, the AI Mouse" will attract contributors from various backgrounds (game dev, AI, neuroscience, education) to collaborate. This inclusive approach will accelerate the development and lead to creative extensions that one team alone might not think of. Ultimately, the community will help guide the project’s evolution toward the vision of a versatile AI memory research playground.

## Implementation Roadmap and Milestones  
Developing "Jerry, the AI Mouse" will be an iterative process. We outline a roadmap with milestones that progressively build the simulator’s features. Each milestone results in a functional prototype or addition that can be tested and demonstrated:

1. **Milestone 1: Proof-of-Concept Prototype**  
   *Timeline: Month 1* – Set up the basic scaffolding and get a minimal simulation running. In this stage, we implement the simplest version of each core component to validate the loop:
   - Create a basic *Environment* (e.g., a very small grid world or open area with one reward spot).
   - Implement a trivial *Memory Engine* – initially, this could be a random action policy or a simple table that gets updated (essentially just enough to hold a value for one state). The goal is to ensure the interfaces work, not to achieve intelligent behavior yet.
   - Implement the *Trainer* loop that runs Jerry through the environment and updates something (even if Jerry is not learning much yet, just ensure the loop of state -> action -> reward -> update runs without errors).
   - *Reward logic*: define a basic reward (e.g., +1 for reaching goal, 0 otherwise).
   - Basic *Console Output* as a placeholder for GUI: print the state and reward at each step, maybe a textual representation of the grid world each time Jerry moves.
   - **Success criteria:** We can run a script and see Jerry move around (even if randomly) and eventually reach a goal, with the program detecting that and ending the episode. All modules communicate properly (no placeholder unfilled). Essentially, “Hello World” of the simulator – it runs and doesn’t crash. This milestone will also involve setting up the GitHub repo, CI, and writing initial docs so that others could run this prototype.

2. **Milestone 2: Basic Learning & Memory Integration**  
   *Timeline: Month 2-3* – Now we introduce a simple but real learning mechanism and show improvement in a task:
   - Choose one core task (likely the **maze navigation**) and implement a small maze environment (could be hardcoded for now).
   - Upgrade the *Memory Engine* to an initial learning model. For example, implement Q-learning with a twist: include a rudimentary memory of visited states. One approach is giving the agent a **limited memory of past visitation** (so it can avoid looping) or a way to mark states as having been rewarding. Alternatively, implement a small neural network with one hidden layer that takes the current state and perhaps a bit of memory input, and outputs Q-values for actions.
   - The *Trainer* will incorporate an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) and train the memory engine’s parameters or Q-values over many episodes.
   - Add a simple *GUI display* for the maze: perhaps using Pygame or a matplotlib plot that refreshes. At this stage, it can be very primitive (colored grid cells, with a mouse icon and a cheese icon).
   - Evaluate and confirm that Jerry learns: for instance, measure the steps to goal over episodes and ensure it decreases. We can run 100 episodes and show a chart of Jerry’s performance improving.
   - **Deliverable:** A working simulator where Jerry starts naive and after training can solve the small maze consistently. Memory may be implicit in Q-values here, but we set the stage for more explicit memory usage. We’ll document these results and possibly make a short demo video to attract interest.

3. **Milestone 3: Associative Memory & Multiple Tasks**  
   *Timeline: Month 4-5* – Expand the memory capabilities and add the other example tasks (cue association, trap avoidance):
   - Design the *Associative Memory Structure*: This could be a graph-based memory or an augmented neural network. For example, implement a component where Jerry stores sequences of states that led to rewards in a replay buffer, and periodically (or during inactivity) replays them to itself (like hippocampal replay). Another feature: allow the agent to simulate a move in its head (query the memory for what might happen) before executing (this is tricky but even a one-step lookahead using learned transition models could be a start).
   - Implement the **Cue-Reward** environment: a simple arena where a cue is given (we can simulate a cue by a variable or a light object in the environment) and then place a reward accordingly. Ensure Jerry’s sensors include the cue.
   - Implement the **Trap** environment: perhaps reuse the maze but mark one tile as a trap (unseen to Jerry initially). Or a separate environment that’s just a straight path with a trap.
   - Extend the *Reward Engine* to handle these scenarios (negative reward for trap, etc.) and ensure Jerry’s learning loop can handle both positive and negative reinforcement.
   - Introduce initial *Visualizations*: e.g., a textual print or simple graph of memory values. Perhaps output Jerry’s memory table of cue -> reward predictions to show it learned the cue significance.
   - **Testing:** Verify that in the cue-reward task Jerry learns to go to the correct spot upon cue (we expect near 100% correct after training). In the trap task, verify Jerry’s path avoidance improves. At this milestone, we essentially have a mini-suite of tasks to validate the memory system’s versatility.
   - We will likely release this as **v0.1** or similar, inviting the community to try these tasks and suggest improvements.

4. **Milestone 4: Enhanced GUI and Godot Integration**  
   *Timeline: Month 6-7* – Improve the interface and user experience:
   - Port or integrate the simulation with Godot (or a chosen engine). This might involve writing a Godot application that can call the Python logic, or reimplementing some logic in Godot’s script. The goal is to have a nice visualization: Jerry as a sprite or simple 2D character moving in the maze, rather than just colored blocks.
   - Add interactive controls (play/pause, speed) and real-time charts in the GUI. Possibly use Godot’s UI nodes for graphs or embed a small plotting library.
   - Improve the memory visualization: maybe depict memory as a graph on screen or a pop-up window that updates.
   - Cross-platform tests: ensure the Godot version runs on Windows, Mac, Linux. Possibly attempt an HTML5 export to test browser performance.
   - By this point, polish the documentation with a quickstart guide: “run this binary or open this HTML to see Jerry learn.”
   - **Outcome:** A user-friendly simulator where someone can watch Jerry learn in an animated environment. This will be great for demonstrations and could be used to showcase the project (for example, in a YouTube video or at a meetup). We may call this **v1.0**, indicating the simulator is fully functional with GUI and core features.

5. **Milestone 5: Tom the Cat and Multi-Agent Prototype**  
   *Timeline: Month 8-10* – Tackle the addition of an adversarial agent and multi-agent architecture:
   - Implement Tom as an entity in the environment. Start simple: Tom could move randomly or along a fixed route, just to have an obstacle for Jerry. Then implement a basic chasing behavior (e.g., every few steps, Tom moves closer to Jerry’s position). Evaluate the performance impact of having two agents.
   - Modify the environment and trainer to handle two agents. Possibly treat Tom as part of the environment dynamics from Jerry’s perspective (if Tom is not learning initially). If making Tom learn, we might run two learning loops or a combined multi-agent learning algorithm (which is complex; we might hold off full RL for Tom in the first iteration).
   - Define the reward structure for multi-agent: e.g., Jerry gets negative reward if caught; maybe Tom gets positive (if we actually make it an agent).
   - Test scenarios: Can Jerry learn to avoid Tom effectively? We might need to give Jerry some sensory input about Tom’s location (like vision or smell range).
   - This milestone is exploratory and will likely involve tweaking the memory system to handle dynamic threats. It will validate that our architecture can accommodate another agent without major refactor (if we find issues, we will adjust the design accordingly).
   - **Deliverable:** A new demo mode, perhaps "Cat and Mouse", where users can see Tom chasing Jerry in a maze. If Jerry’s learning goes well, he should figure out to grab cheese in a way that avoids crossing paths with Tom, even if it means taking longer routes or waiting for Tom to leave an area. This will be a significant showpiece for the platform’s extensibility.

6. **Milestone 6: Community Expansion and Refinement**  
   *Timeline: Month 11-12 and beyond* – After the major features are in place, the focus shifts to community-driven growth and refinement:
   - Address feedback and contributions from users who have been testing the earlier versions. This might include optimizing code, adding requested features, or fixing bugs.
   - Merging user-contributed environments or memory modules that have matured in their forks. For example, if someone contributed a radial arm maze or a different learning algorithm (say, Sarsa or DQN implementation), integrate those as optional modules.
   - Improve performance where possible: profile the Python code and see if any part can be sped up (maybe heavy loops can be numpy-fied, or we add an option to use PyPy or Cython for the hot parts).
   - Enrich the visualization tools based on what was learned. Possibly add a memory playback feature (reconstructing an episode from memory to show what Jerry “remembers”), or a comparison view to show difference between an agent with memory vs. one without on the same task.
   - At this stage, we might also implement more of the biological tie-ins: e.g., parameterize the memory engine to mimic certain hippocampal phenomena (like limit on memory capacity to force forgetting, or adding noise to simulate cognitive map realignment) and see how it affects learning. These could be toggled for research experiments.
   - **Version 2.0 release:** Once the simulator is robust and has a variety of features, we’ll release a more polished version, possibly with a paper or article describing its design. The roadmap doesn’t end here – future directions include adding a library of different agent “brains” (so users can choose between a purely model-free RL agent vs. our memory-based agent and compare performance), and perhaps scaling up scenarios (bigger mazes, procedurally generated levels for more challenge).

Throughout this roadmap, after each milestone, we will reassess to ensure we’re meeting the goals of **low-end accessibility** and **modularity**. If anything becomes too slow or convoluted, we’ll refactor or trim it in the next iteration. This incremental approach ensures that at any given time, we have a working simulator we can show, rather than a long period of development with nothing usable. It also means the community can get involved early (after Milestone 2, for example, contributors could start adding levels or tweaking parameters). 

By following this roadmap, "Jerry, the AI Mouse" will evolve from a simple demo into a rich platform for AI memory system research and education. At each step, we demonstrate new capabilities (from basic learning to planning to multi-agent interaction), all while keeping the system understandable and hackable. The end goal is a **baseline testing environment** for biologically inspired AI memory systems that others can use as a benchmark or playground, with extensibility to ever more complex cognition, agents, and tasks as the community and interest grow.
