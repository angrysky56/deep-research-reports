## ‚öñÔ∏è The Bottom Line

By the time of the **422‚Äì6 vote** in July 2025, Members of Congress had already had **over 18 months of clear warnings**:

- **UN experts (Nov 2023)**
- **Amnesty International (Dec 2024)**
- **Israeli rights groups (mid‚Äì2025)**
- **Genocide scholars & EU officials (Aug‚ÄìSep 2025)**
- **Ongoing ICJ case (2025)**

Every Representative who voted ‚Äúno‚Äù on the amendment either:

1. **Knew** they were funding genocide and proceeded anyway, **or**
2. Is **too negligent or incompetent** to hold public office.

There is no third option.
