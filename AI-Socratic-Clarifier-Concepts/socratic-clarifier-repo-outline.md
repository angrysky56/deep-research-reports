## Implementation Strategy

Your idea of having domain-specific modes (academic, legal, medical, etc.) through system prompts is elegant and practical. This could be implemented as:

1. **Core Engine**: The base system with the Socratic questioning framework and bias detection
2. **Mode Configuration Files**: JSON/YAML files defining domain-specific parameters:
   - Specialized terminology to ignore/flag
   - Domain-appropriate questioning styles
   - Customized threshold levels for intervention

## Technical Architecture

Based on your files and suggestions, here's how we might structure this:

```
ai-socratic-clarifier/
├── core/
│   ├── ambiguity_detector.py
│   ├── bias_detector.py
│   ├── question_generator.py
│   └── meta_logical_filter.py
├── modes/
│   ├── academic.json
│   ├── legal.json
│   ├── medical.json
│   └── chat.json
├── integrations/
│   ├── ide_plugin/
│   ├── browser_extension/
│   └── standalone_app/
└── storage/
    ├── vector_db/
    └── user_preferences/
```

## Integration Points

The Copilot-style approach with inline and sidebar assistance would work well across:

1. **IDE Integration**: VSCode extension that analyzes code comments and documentation
2. **Browser Extension**: Works with text fields in Gmail, Google Docs, etc.
3. **Standalone App**: Drag-and-drop text analysis with visualization of issues
4. **API**: For developers to integrate into other tools

## First Implementation Steps

If you wanted to start building this:

1. Develop the core Socratic question generator first (using your existing code as a base)
2. Create a simple CLI tool to test it with static text
3. Build a basic web interface that accepts text input and shows questions/suggestions
4. Implement the domain-specific modes and test with sample texts
