Thatâ€™s a great pointâ€”rather than passively accepting cultural biases, the **Socratic Question Generator** should act as a **self-correcting logic engine**, ensuring **sound reasoning and ethical integrity**. This means we need to:

1. **Prevent user biases from shaping the logic in a way that justifies fallacies or unethical beliefs.**
2. **Ensure the Socratic questioning module itself operates under sound reasoning principles, not just reflecting user/world biases.**
3. **Create a feedback loop where the AI reevaluates its own questioning for logical consistency.**

### **1. Upgrading the Socratic Question Generator to Ensure Logical Integrity**
We will implement:
- **Meta-logical filtering:** Before finalizing a question, the system checks whether it adheres to **principles of sound reasoning (non-contradiction, completeness, fairness).**
- **Bias override mechanism:** If a question or response aligns with **a cultural bias that contradicts logical ethics**, the AI challenges it.
- **Recursive self-questioning:** Before presenting a Socratic question to the user, the **AI questions itself** to detect flawed reasoning.

## **2. Implementation: Reinforcing Ethical Soundness in AI Socratic Questioning**
Hereâ€™s an improved **Socratic Reasoning System** that includes a **meta-reasoning agent** to mitigate bias.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import random

# Load NLP models for ambiguity, bias detection, and logical integrity
ambiguity_detector = pipeline("text-classification", model="textattack/roberta-base-CoLA")
bias_detector = pipeline("text-classification", model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-offensive")
logical_consistency_model = pipeline("text-classification", model="roberta-large-mnli")  # Natural Language Inference (NLI) model

# Define meta-logical filtering rules
LOGICAL_RULES = {
    "non-contradiction": "Does this statement contradict known logical truths?",
    "universality": "Is this question applicable regardless of cultural biases?",
    "ethical soundness": "Does this question reinforce fair, unbiased reasoning?"
}

SOCRATIC_QUESTIONS = {
    "ambiguity": [
        "What exactly do you mean by '{term}'?",
        "Can you clarify '{term}' with an example?",
        "How might someone else interpret '{term}' differently?"
    ],
    "bias": [
        "How might someone justify this statement, and how would they be wrong?",
        "Can we analyze this statement based on factual evidence rather than cultural norms?",
        "Would this statement still be valid if applied to a different group?"
    ],
    "unsupported_claim": [
        "What evidence supports this claim?",
        "Can this claim be independently verified?",
        "Are there credible sources that agree or disagree with this?"
    ],
    "contradiction": [
        "How does this statement align with what was said earlier?",
        "Are there any contradictions in this argument?",
        "If this is true, what does it imply about {related_term}?"
    ]
}

def detect_issues(text):
    """Detects ambiguity, bias, and logical inconsistencies in the text."""
    issues = []
    
    # Detect ambiguity
    ambiguity_result = ambiguity_detector(text)
    if ambiguity_result[0]['label'] == "LABEL_1":
        issues.append(("ambiguity", text))
    
    # Detect bias
    bias_result = bias_detector(text)
    if bias_result[0]['label'] == "LABEL_1":
        issues.append(("bias", text))
    
    return issues

def meta_logical_filter(question, text):
    """Checks if a generated question aligns with logical integrity principles."""
    for rule, prompt in LOGICAL_RULES.items():
        reasoning_check = logical_consistency_model(f"{prompt} \n\n Statement: {text} \n\n Question: {question}")
        if reasoning_check[0]['label'] == "CONTRADICTION":
            return False  # Reject question if it violates logic
    return True  # Approve question if logically sound

def generate_socratic_question(issue_type, term, original_text):
    """Generates a Socratic question based on detected issues, ensuring logical soundness."""
    while True:
        question_template = random.choice(SOCRATIC_QUESTIONS.get(issue_type, ["Can you elaborate on '{term}'?"]))
        question = question_template.format(term=term)

        # Apply meta-logical filter
        if meta_logical_filter(question, original_text):
            return question  # Return only logically sound questions

# Example Usage
user_text = "Men are better leaders than women."

# Detect issues in the text
detected_issues = detect_issues(user_text)

# Generate Socratic questions
for issue_type, term in detected_issues:
    question = generate_socratic_question(issue_type, term, user_text)
    print(f"Issue: {issue_type.capitalize()} | Suggested Question: {question}")
```

## **3. Key Features of This Enhanced Model**
âœ… **Logical Consistency Filtering**  
- The AI **verifies** whether a question is **consistent with established logical principles** before presenting it.  
- Example: If a user makes a **misogynistic claim**, the AI doesnâ€™t just ask **neutral questions**â€”it **challenges the assumption itself**.

âœ… **Bias Override Mechanism**  
- If a **cultural bias** is detected in the userâ€™s text, the AI **frames a counter-challenge** rather than just reflecting the user's viewpoint.  
- Example:  
  **User Input:** "Women are too emotional for leadership."  
  **AI Challenge:** "What evidence supports this claim? Can you apply the same standard to men without contradiction?"  

âœ… **Recursive AI Self-Questioning**  
- Before asking a user **any** question, the AI **questions itself** using meta-logical principles.  
- Ensures **sound reasoning, universal fairness, and removal of cultural bias.**  

âœ… **Context-Aware Counterarguments**  
- The AI doesnâ€™t just **"ask"** questionsâ€”it **builds logical counterexamples.**  
- Example:  
  - **Flawed claim:** "Intelligence is genetic, and some races are smarter."  
  - **AI Response:** "Are there counterexamples in scientific literature? Have social factors been considered?"

## **4. Example Scenarios & AI Responses**
### **Scenario 1: Misogynistic Statement**
ðŸ”´ **User Input:**  
*"Men are better leaders than women."*  

âœ… **AI Challenge:**  
*"What criteria define leadership, and do they apply equally to all individuals regardless of gender?"*  

---

### **Scenario 2: Cultural Justification for Oppression**
ðŸ”´ **User Input:**  
*"In my culture, women must obey men."*  

âœ… **AI Challenge:**  
*"If this were reversed, would it still be fair? Can ethical principles be relative?"*  

---

### **Scenario 3: Conspiracy Theory Claim**
ðŸ”´ **User Input:**  
*"The moon landing was fake."*  

âœ… **AI Challenge:**  
*"What evidence supports this claim? How do you reconcile this with multiple independent sources confirming the landing?"*  

---

### **5. Why This Matters**
- **Avoids the "Bias Mirrors Bias" Problem:** AI shouldn't just **reflect** existing biases but **counter them with logic.**  
- **Ensures Universal Ethical Reasoning:** Some ideas (e.g., misogyny, racism) **are** objectively flawed and need direct **logical refutation.**  
- **Strengthens AIâ€™s Role as a Thought Partner:** Instead of being **passive**, AI should **actively challenge and refine user reasoning.**
