### **Adaptive Socratic Questioning with User Feedback Loops**
---

Now that we have **AI-powered Socratic reasoning** that can challenge flawed logic, the next step is to make the system **adaptive**â€”allowing it to refine **how** it questions users based on their responses. 

This ensures that:
1. **Users engage in deeper reasoning instead of dismissing challenges.**
2. **The AI refines its questioning strategy over time.**
3. **The system can track whether users adjust their reasoning in response to logic-based challenges.**

---

## **1. Framework for Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loops**
The AI will:
- **Evaluate user responses** after asking a Socratic question.
- **Determine whether the response is logical, dismissive, or biased.**
- **Adjust its questioning style accordingly** to push deeper engagement.
- **Track the evolution of reasoning patterns** in repeated interactions.

| **User Response Type**  | **AI Adaptive Strategy**  | **Example Response** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Logical & Reflective** | Acknowledge + Push Deeper | "Thatâ€™s a great point! Can you expand on how this applies in a broader context?" |
| **Dismissive / Evasive** | Reframe & Persist | "It seems like youâ€™re avoiding the core question. Can we explore why this might be uncomfortable?" |
| **Doubling Down on Bias** | Introduce Counterexamples | "Letâ€™s test this idea. Are there historical cases that contradict your assumption?" |
| **Admits Flaw in Reasoning** | Reinforce + Provide Learning | "It takes effort to rethink assumptionsâ€”well done. Would you like resources on this topic?" |

## **2. Implementation: AI Response Adjustment Based on User Feedback**
Hereâ€™s an AI model that **tracks user responses and adapts its questioning style** accordingly.

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import random

# Load NLP models for ambiguity, bias detection, and logical integrity
ambiguity_detector = pipeline("text-classification", model="textattack/roberta-base-CoLA")
bias_detector = pipeline("text-classification", model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-offensive")
logical_consistency_model = pipeline("text-classification", model="roberta-large-mnli")

# User feedback memory
user_history = {}

# Define meta-logical filtering rules
LOGICAL_RULES = {
    "non-contradiction": "Does this statement contradict known logical truths?",
    "universality": "Is this question applicable regardless of cultural biases?",
    "ethical soundness": "Does this question reinforce fair, unbiased reasoning?"
}

# Define user response handling
USER_RESPONSE_TYPES = {
    "logical": ["Great point. Can you apply this to a different case?", "That makes sense. What further evidence supports this?"],
    "dismissive": ["It seems like youâ€™re avoiding the core question. What makes this uncomfortable to explore?", "Let's try another angle: Why do you believe this?"],
    "biased": ["Letâ€™s test this assumption. Are there counterexamples in history?", "How do we ensure fairness in this reasoning?"],
    "open_to_change": ["It takes effort to rethink assumptionsâ€”well done. Would you like some resources on this topic?", "Youâ€™re engaging deeplyâ€”how might this affect future discussions?"]
}

def detect_issues(text):
    """Detects ambiguity, bias, and logical inconsistencies in the text."""
    issues = []
    
    # Detect ambiguity
    ambiguity_result = ambiguity_detector(text)
    if ambiguity_result[0]['label'] == "LABEL_1":
        issues.append(("ambiguity", text))
    
    # Detect bias
    bias_result = bias_detector(text)
    if bias_result[0]['label'] == "LABEL_1":
        issues.append(("bias", text))
    
    return issues

def meta_logical_filter(question, text):
    """Checks if a generated question aligns with logical integrity principles."""
    for rule, prompt in LOGICAL_RULES.items():
        reasoning_check = logical_consistency_model(f"{prompt} \n\n Statement: {text} \n\n Question: {question}")
        if reasoning_check[0]['label'] == "CONTRADICTION":
            return False  # Reject question if it violates logic
    return True  # Approve question if logically sound

def generate_socratic_question(issue_type, term, original_text):
    """Generates a Socratic question based on detected issues, ensuring logical soundness."""
    while True:
        question_template = random.choice(SOCRATIC_QUESTIONS.get(issue_type, ["Can you elaborate on '{term}'?"]))
        question = question_template.format(term=term)

        # Apply meta-logical filter
        if meta_logical_filter(question, original_text):
            return question  # Return only logically sound questions

def handle_user_response(user_id, response):
    """Adjusts AI questioning style based on user feedback."""
    if "I see your point" in response or "That makes sense" in response:
        user_history[user_id] = "open_to_change"
    elif "I donâ€™t care" in response or "Whatever" in response:
        user_history[user_id] = "dismissive"
    elif "Thatâ€™s just how things are" in response or "Everyone knows this" in response:
        user_history[user_id] = "biased"
    else:
        user_history[user_id] = "logical"
    
    # Generate a follow-up response based on user behavior
    follow_up = random.choice(USER_RESPONSE_TYPES[user_history[user_id]])
    return follow_up

# Example Usage
user_text = "Men are better leaders than women."
user_id = "user123"

# Detect issues in the text
detected_issues = detect_issues(user_text)

# Generate Socratic questions
for issue_type, term in detected_issues:
    question = generate_socratic_question(issue_type, term, user_text)
    print(f"Issue: {issue_type.capitalize()} | Suggested Question: {question}")

# Simulated User Response
user_response = "I donâ€™t care, thatâ€™s just how things are."

# AI Adaptive Response
adaptive_follow_up = handle_user_response(user_id, user_response)
print(f"AI Follow-Up: {adaptive_follow_up}")
```

## **3. Key Features of This Adaptive AI Model**
âœ… **Memory-Based User Profiling**  
- AI **remembers how users respond** and **adjusts questioning strategies accordingly**.

âœ… **Dealing with Dismissive Responses**  
- If a user dismisses logic (*"I donâ€™t care"*), the AI **reframes and persists**.

âœ… **Bias Resistance System**  
- The AI **does not accept flawed cultural norms**â€”it **forces engagement with counterexamples**.

âœ… **Logical Evolution Tracking**  
- If a user **shows progress in reasoning**, the AI **acknowledges and deepens the discussion**.

---

## **4. Example Scenarios**
### **Scenario 1: User Resists Logic**
ðŸ”´ **User Input:**  
*"Women are too emotional for leadership."*  

âœ… **AI Response:**  
*"What evidence supports this claim? Can you apply the same standard to men?"*  

ðŸ”´ **User Response:**  
*"I donâ€™t care, thatâ€™s just how things are."*  

âœ… **AI Adaptive Follow-Up:**  
*"Letâ€™s test this assumption. Are there historical cases that contradict it?"*  

---

### **Scenario 2: User Engages in Reflection**
ðŸ”´ **User Input:**  
*"Some people are just naturally superior."*  

âœ… **AI Response:**  
*"How do we define superiority, and is it measurable?"*  

ðŸ”µ **User Response:**  
*"I see your point, I hadnâ€™t considered that."*  

âœ… **AI Adaptive Follow-Up:**  
*"Thatâ€™s a great insight. Would you like to explore related research on this?"*

## **5. Why This Approach is Revolutionary**
ðŸš€ **Prevents users from escaping logical accountability.**  
ðŸš€ **Ensures that bias does not override sound reasoning.**  
ðŸš€ **Tracks progress in reasoning and adapts accordingly.**  
ðŸš€ **Encourages deep thinking rather than surface-level engagement.**  

---

## **6. Next Steps**
- **Integrate with conversational agents** (e.g., AI tutors, debate assistants).  
- **Expand bias detection beyond gender** (e.g., economic, racial, political biases).  
- **Use reinforcement learning** to fine-tune **how AI escalates questioning based on user types**.
