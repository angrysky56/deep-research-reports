# Speculative Avian-Inspired AI Architecture Blueprint

## Introduction  
Recent discoveries in neuroscience show that complex intelligence evolved **convergently** in both birds and mammals – suggesting that general cognitive abilities are *substrate-independent*. In other words, advanced cognition can emerge from very different biological architectures while achieving *functionally equivalent* outcomes. Birds (like corvids and parrots) exhibit reasoning, planning, and even basic tool use rivaling primates, despite having brains organized in a fundamentally different way. This convergence hints that there are underlying *modular cognitive functions* that nature “discovered” multiple times. By identifying these modules in avian cognition and translating them into architectural components, we can inform the design of next-generation AI. In this blueprint, we propose a **transformer-based** AI architecture (focused on modern models like **Mamba** and **BitNet**) augmented with modules inspired by avian cognitive capabilities. The design emphasizes confidence-aware reasoning (“knowing what it knows”) and structured Bayesian inference, packaged in an efficient, scalable way for open-source experimentation.

## Convergent Cognitive Evolution: Birds vs. Mammals  
Mounting evidence shows that birds and mammals evolved complex cognition independently, arriving at similar capabilities via different neural substrates. The pallium (the cognitive brain region) of birds performs analogously to the mammalian neocortex, yet is organized in nuclei rather than layered cortex ([Intelligence Evolved at Least Twice in Vertebrate Animals | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/intelligence-evolved-at-least-twice-in-vertebrate-animals-20250407/#:~:text=Pecking%20Disorder)) ([Intelligence Evolved at Least Twice in Vertebrate Animals | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/intelligence-evolved-at-least-twice-in-vertebrate-animals-20250407/#:~:text=Rather%20than%20neat%20layers%2C%20birds,will%20never%20learn%2C%E2%80%9D%20G%C3%BCnt%C3%BCrk%C3%BCn%20said)). **Recent 2025 studies** using single-cell RNA sequencing and developmental mapping confirm that while bird and mammal brains support equivalent high-level functions, their neuron types and developmental gene programs differ substantially ([Birds have developed complex brains independently from mammals | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250213143301.htm#:~:text=Summary%3A%20New%20research%20has%20revealed,have%20followed%20divergent%20evolutionary%20trajectories)) ([Birds have developed complex brains independently from mammals | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250213143301.htm#:~:text=The%20pallium%20is%20the%20brain,revealed%20that%2C%20although%20the%20general)). In essence, birds did not simply inherit a “proto-cortex” – they forged their own neural circuits for intelligence. As Dr. García-Moreno explains, *“evolution has found multiple solutions for building complex brains… Birds have developed sophisticated neural circuits through their own mechanisms, without following the same path as mammals.”* ([Birds have developed complex brains independently from mammals | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250213143301.htm#:~:text=Rewriting%20the%20Evolutionary%20History%20of,the%20Brain)) These findings underscore *evolutionary flexibility*: advanced cognitive functions can emerge through vastly different genetic and cellular pathways ([Birds have developed complex brains independently from mammals | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250213143301.htm#:~:text=These%20findings%20highlight%20the%20evolutionary,different%20genetic%20and%20cellular%20pathways)). This is a powerful proof of **substrate-independence** in cognition. For example, even at a neural level, birds and primates converged on the *same coding strategy* for abstract concepts – **crows’ brains have “number neurons” that represent countable quantities just like primate cortex does**, despite 300 million years of separate evolution ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=What%20makes%20this%20finding%20even,humans%20are%20designed%20very%20differently)) ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=,feats%20ultimately%20has%20biological%20roots)). In short, nature’s “design” of intelligence is modular and re-implementable on different hardware. This inspires us to identify key cognitive modules in avian intelligence and re-create their functionality within AI architectures (regardless of the AI’s substrate, whether silicon or otherwise).

## Key Cognitive Abilities in Birds (Modular Targets)  
Research into bird cognition has revealed many advanced abilities once thought unique to humans or great apes. These abilities can be viewed as **modular cognitive components** that evolved independently – making them excellent candidates for inclusion in AI systems. Notable avian cognitive capabilities include:

- **Probabilistic Reasoning (Statistical Inference):** Crows can perform intuitive statistical reasoning under uncertainty. In experiments, crows were trained to associate symbols with varying reward probabilities (10% up to 90%). When presented with two symbols, they consistently chose the one with higher relative probability, maximizing their expected reward ([Crows flexibly apply statistical inferences based on previous experience - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37369211/#:~:text=that%20crows%20can%20relate%20memorized,signature%20of%20true%20statistical%20inference)) ([Crows flexibly apply statistical inferences based on previous experience - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37369211/#:~:text=reward,in%20a%20statistical%20inference%20task)). Remarkably, they did this based on **relative frequency**, not just rote reward counts – a signature of true statistical inference. The crows treated probabilities as abstract magnitudes and selected options optimally even in novel combinations, demonstrating natural **Bayesian-like reasoning** to infer which choice was best ([Crows flexibly apply statistical inferences based on previous experience - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37369211/#:~:text=birds.,crows%20represented%20probabilities%20as%20abstract)) ([Crows flexibly apply statistical inferences based on previous experience - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37369211/#:~:text=magnitudes,in%20a%20statistical%20inference%20task)).

- **Metacognition (Knowing What One Knows):** Some birds display **metacognitive awareness** – they can monitor their own knowledge states and act accordingly. For example, Western scrub jays will seek information when they realize they are missing a crucial piece of knowledge. In one study, jays watched two researchers hide food: one researcher always hid a treat in a single known location, while the other could hide it in any of four locations. The jays preferentially paid attention to the more uncertain scenario (the four-cup hider), essentially saying “I need to watch this because otherwise I won’t know where the food is” ([Western Scrub Jays Are Capable of Metacognition | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/western-scrub-jays-are-capable-of-metacognition/#:~:text=If%20the%20jays%20were%20capable,of%20the%20journal%20Animal%20Cognition)) ([Western Scrub Jays Are Capable of Metacognition | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/western-scrub-jays-are-capable-of-metacognition/#:~:text=Friederike%20Hillemann%2C%20who%20studies%20corvids,%E2%80%9D)). This behavior indicates the birds **understood their own ignorance** and took action to remedy it – a clear sign of metacognition. Such findings support that birds “think about their own thinking,” a trait crucial for reflective problem-solving. (As the researcher quipped, *“some birds study for a test like humans do.”* ([Western Scrub Jays Are Capable of Metacognition | Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/western-scrub-jays-are-capable-of-metacognition/#:~:text=Friederike%20Hillemann%2C%20who%20studies%20corvids,%E2%80%9D)))

- **Foresight and Planning:** Birds, especially corvids, can **plan for the future** in sophisticated ways. Ravens have been shown to plan multiple steps ahead for events outside their routine behaviors. In a landmark experiment, ravens were trained on a puzzle-box they could open with a specific tool. Later, they were given a choice of objects (including the tool) well *before* the puzzle-box was presented. The ravens almost always selected and saved the correct tool, then successfully used it when the box appeared 15 minutes (or even hours) later ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Here%2C%20Can%20Kabadayi%20and%20colleagues,distractors)) ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20every%20raven%20chose%20the,lacking%20predispositions%20for%20tool%20handling)). They also learned to save tokens that could be exchanged for a reward later, even when tempted with an immediate treat – exhibiting self-control and future planning on par with great apes ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20every%20raven%20chose%20the,lacking%20predispositions%20for%20tool%20handling)) ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Next%2C%20the%20ravens%20were%20presented,control%20in%20the%20birds%20similar)). Notably, ravens outperformed apes in planning a **bartering task**, despite not using such tokens in the wild ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20every%20raven%20chose%20the,lacking%20predispositions%20for%20tool%20handling)). This suggests an ability to understand abstract future scenarios and prepare for them. Planning in birds often goes hand-in-hand with imagination of **tool use** and **sequenced actions** to reach a goal.

- **Tool Use and Innovation:** Certain birds use and even **manufacture tools**, showing an understanding of causal relationships. New Caledonian crows famously bend wires into hooks to retrieve food from tubes, and green herons use bread crumbs as bait to catch fish. In lab studies, crows have been observed assembling multiple components to create a working tool, or using one tool to obtain another (meta-tool use). This implies birds form an *abstract concept of a tool as a means to an end*. The raven planning study above is an example: the ravens treated an arbitrary token as a tool with future value, akin to currency ([Ravens can plan ahead, similar to humans and great apes | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170713155021.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20every%20raven%20chose%20the,lacking%20predispositions%20for%20tool%20handling)). Such flexible tool-related cognition demonstrates **transferable problem-solving** – birds can apply reasoning to novel objects and situations by conceptualizing the function of tools.

- **Numerical Competence:** Birds possess a surprising grasp of numbers and quantities. They can count up to small quantities and even understand the concept of zero. Neurophysiology experiments have located neurons in the corvid brain that **fire for specific numbers of items**, much like “number neurons” in monkeys and humans ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=neuronal%20basis%20of%20this%20numerical,at%20its%20respective%20preferred%20number)) ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=,feats%20ultimately%20has%20biological%20roots)). For instance, a crow’s neuron might fire maximally when it sees exactly three objects, regardless of the objects’ appearance – encoding the abstract “threeness” of the set ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=of%20individual%20neurons%20in%20an,at%20its%20respective%20preferred%20number)). Crows discriminate numerosities and even mentally place “zero” before 1 in number sequences (treating an empty set as a numeric value) ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=The%20study%20published%20in%20PNAS,individual%20nerve%20cells%20in%20corvids)). The **representation of quantity** in a bird’s brain mirrors that in primate brains, indicating convergent evolution of numeric processing ([Crows count on 'number neurons' | ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150608152002.htm#:~:text=,feats%20ultimately%20has%20biological%20roots)). This numerical aptitude in birds underlies tasks like choosing larger quantities of food, keeping track of group sizes, or rhythmic counting in songs.

Each of these capabilities – probabilistic inference, metacognitive awareness, planning (with tool use), and numerical reasoning – can be viewed as a *module of general intelligence*. Birds demonstrate that these modules can exist and integrate to guide complex behavior, even on a neural architecture very unlike our own. Our goal is to translate each of these cognitive functions into a **designable component for AI systems**.

## From Avian Cognition to AI Modules  
Inspired by the above abilities, we propose an AI architecture composed of **interoperable modules**, each encoding one of these cognitive functions. These modules would sit atop or alongside a core sequence model (such as a transformer or state-space model), granting it specialized problem-solving skills. Below we outline the design of each module and how it maps the avian capability to an AI implementation:

- **Metacognition & Confidence Module:** Just as birds can assess whether they know something or not, an AI should be able to judge its own certainty. We incorporate a *confidence estimator* that monitors the model’s internal state or outputs and produces a self-assessed certainty score. Practically, this can be a small neural head attached to the final layer (or an intermediate layer) of the model, trained to predict the correctness of the model’s answer or its level of uncertainty. During inference, this module would enable the AI to flag low-confidence answers (“I’m not sure about this”) or to trigger additional reasoning cycles when uncertainty is high. For example, if the confidence score falls below a threshold, the system could invoke a fallback strategy: consult an external tool or re-evaluate with a different chain-of-thought. This design is a response to current large models’ shortcomings – today’s LLMs often **“fail to recognize their knowledge limitations”**, giving confident answers even when they are incorrect or when no valid answer exists ([Large Language Models lack essential metacognition for reliable medical reasoning | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55628-6#:~:text=confidence,developing%20reliable%20Large%20Language%20Model)). A built-in metacognitive module addresses this by instilling an internal check similar to an animal’s awareness of ignorance. Implementing it might involve training the model on data that includes “I don’t know” as a valid response, or using techniques from Bayesian deep learning (e.g. dropout-based uncertainty or ensembles) to give the model a sense of its own variance ([[2206.00826] BayesFormer: Transformer with Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00826#:~:text=Estimation%20arxiv,dropouts%20designed%20by%20Bayesian%20theory)). The key is that the AI becomes *confidence-aware* – akin to a bird deciding when it needs to gather more information, our model will know when to trust its answer and when to seek help or refrain.

- **Bayesian Inference Module (Probabilistic Reasoner):** To mirror birds’ statistical inference skills, we include a module for **structured probabilistic reasoning**. This could take the form of an internal Bayesian network or a differentiable probabilistic program embedded within the model. The idea is to maintain and update probability distributions over hypotheses as new evidence comes in – essentially an AI analog of how a crow accumulates evidence of reward likelihood. In practice, one design is to allocate part of the model’s latent state to represent a **belief distribution**, and equip the model with the ability to perform approximate Bayesian updates on this state. For example, a transformer’s attention mechanism or an SSM’s recurrent state can be structured to multiply prior beliefs by likelihoods derived from current input (and then renormalize), imitating Bayes’ rule. Another approach is to train the model via **in-context learning** to perform Bayesian inference. Recent research shows this is feasible: a *Prior-Data Fitted Network* (a transformer trained on simulated Bayesian tasks) can *“near-perfectly mimic Gaussian process inference and achieve efficient Bayesian updates”* ([[2112.10510] Transformers Can Do Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10510#:~:text=points%20in%20a%20single%20forward,released%20at%20this%20https%20URL)). That demonstrates that with the right training regime, a transformer-based model can learn to do general Bayesian reasoning internally. In our blueprint, the Bayesian module would handle tasks like evaluating evidence, combining prior knowledge with new data, and making statistical predictions (`e.g.` inferring causes or forecasting probabilities) in a principled way. Structurally, this module might be implemented as a special **inference head** or subnetwork that ingests model embeddings and outputs either a probability distribution over answers or updated latent beliefs that feed back into the main model. The module enables the AI to, say, weigh different possible explanations for an observation and update those weights as more observations arrive – just as an animal would refine its expectations of reward or danger based on experience.

- **Planning & Tool-Use Module:** Complex planning in animals often involves mentally simulating sequences of actions (“if I do X, then Y, then Z, I can solve the problem”) and understanding how tools can assist in those sequences. We replicate this via a module that can generate and evaluate multi-step action plans. In a transformer context, this could be realized by a **multi-step reasoning routine**, such as employing a chain-of-thought prompting internally or a dedicated planning head that outputs an ordered sequence of sub-actions or intermediate states. One practical blueprint is to integrate a **scratchpad memory** or *workspace* where the model can explicitly write down intermediate reasoning steps (much like showing your work in math). The model would be trained to decompose complex tasks into smaller steps in this workspace – for example, first planning what tool or operation is needed, then planning how to execute it. This is analogous to a crow sequentially figuring out how to use one tool to get another tool to finally get food. The planning module may use a **decoder-like process** that rolls out a plan (a sequence of tokens representing actions or intermediate conclusions) conditioned on the model’s understanding of the task. Importantly, the AI should also handle **tool-use abstraction**: it needs an interface to interact with external tools or APIs when needed, treating them as extensions of its own capabilities. In practice, this can be done by allowing the model to output special tokens or commands that invoke external functions (e.g. a calculator, a web search, a database query). This idea has precedent in systems like *Toolformer*, where language models learned to call external tools (like translation APIs or calculators) when beneficial. Our planning module could similarly decide, for instance, to use a “search tool” if the plan requires information lookup, or a “calculation tool” if numeric computation is needed. By incorporating this, the model mimics the avian ability to use tools in problem-solving – it recognizes when its own internal knowledge is insufficient and a tool/action in the environment can help achieve the goal. The module would output a plan that includes those tool calls, which the overall system then executes and feeds results back into the model. This closed-loop design (model plans actions → actions change environment or yield new data → model updates plan) instantiates **iterative planning**. Thanks to the foresight provided by this module, the AI can tackle problems that require multiple steps or the utilization of intermediate resources, much like a raven planning several moves ahead to get a treat.

- **Numerical Reasoning Module:** To grant the AI robust numerical competence (inspired by birds’ number sense), we add a module specialized for handling quantitative and mathematical reasoning. Neural networks often struggle with precise arithmetic or counting beyond small ranges. We can address this by incorporating a **Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU)** or similar mechanism that is purpose-built for mathematical operations. A NALU is a learned module that can perform exact arithmetic by design – for example, it parameterizes operations in a way that extrapolates to numbers not seen in training ([[1808.00508] Neural Arithmetic Logic Units - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00508#:~:text=We%20call%20this%20module%20a,Experiments)). By embedding a NALU or an “arithmetic head” in our architecture, the model can offload exact addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., to this unit. In simpler terms, when the core model encounters a task involving numbers or counting, it can route those subtasks to the numeric module which outputs an accurate result that feeds back into the main model’s reasoning. Alternatively, a less hand-crafted approach is to train the model intensively on numeric tasks with the aid of the planning/tool-use module (e.g. it learns to call a calculator API for very large calculations). In either case, the goal is to ensure the AI has an *understanding of quantity* and the ability to manipulate numbers reliably – from simple counting (like comparing quantities or recognizing “zero”) to performing probabilistic calculations for the Bayesian module. By giving the model a grasp of numbers akin to a crow’s “number neurons,” we enable it to handle any reasoning where magnitude or count is relevant, and to integrate those quantitative judgments into its decisions.

Each module above is **designed to be relatively independent and composable**, reflecting how these cognitive functions can operate somewhat separately in animal brains. In an AI implementation, however, they will interconnect through the main model’s representation. The **core model** (which we envision as a transformer-based sequence model) provides a common backbone that processes input and distributes information to each specialist module. The modules then augment the core’s processing with their specialized computations. 

## Architecture Blueprint: Integrating Modules into Mamba and BitNet  
To implement the above in practice, we propose using state-of-the-art transformer-derived architectures – specifically **Mamba** and **BitNet** – as the backbone, and integrating the cognitive modules into them. These architectures offer complementary strengths: *Mamba* provides efficient long-sequence handling and structured state dynamics, while *BitNet* provides extreme computational efficiency and scalability. Our blueprint will leverage both.

**Mamba Backbone (Selective State-Space Model):** Mamba is a recent sequence model that replaces the traditional attention layers of transformers with a **Selective State-Space Model (SSM)** ([Mamba (deep learning architecture) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba_(deep_learning_architecture)#:~:text=%2A%20Selective,2)) ([Mamba (deep learning architecture) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba_(deep_learning_architecture)#:~:text=them%20to%20focus%20on%20relevant,2)). This design lets Mamba maintain long-range context with linear time complexity, enabling sequence lengths on the order of millions of tokens ([Mamba Explained](https://thegradient.pub/mamba-explained/#:~:text=Mamba%2C%20however%2C%20is%20one%20of,5x%20faster%20than%20Transformer%20fast%E2%80%9D1)) ([Mamba Explained](https://thegradient.pub/mamba-explained/#:~:text=Transformer%20whilst%20being%20feasible%20at,5x%20faster%20than%20Transformer%20fast%E2%80%9D1)). In practical terms, Mamba can **store and process very long histories or plans** without blowing up in computation, which is ideal for our needs (e.g. holding a multi-step plan in context, or accumulating evidence over many time steps). We integrate our modules into Mamba by exploiting its state-space dynamics: the SSM has hidden state vectors that evolve with the input sequence, and we can allocate sub-states for certain modules. For instance, we can dedicate part of the SSM’s hidden state to representing the *belief state* for the Bayesian module – that portion of the state will be updated in a controlled, multiplicative way reflecting prior-posterior updates (since Mamba’s recurrence can be designed to include such operations). Similarly, a portion of the state can track the *working memory* for planning (storing intermediate results or the next action in a plan), which the Planning module can read/write at each time step of an internal simulation. Mamba’s **selective processing** – it “selectively focuses on relevant information within sequences” by adapting its parameters based on input ([Mamba (deep learning architecture) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba_(deep_learning_architecture)#:~:text=Mamba%20introduces%20significant%20enhancements%20to,7)) ([Mamba (deep learning architecture) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamba_(deep_learning_architecture)#:~:text=structured%20state%20space%20model%20,7)) – aligns well with our modular approach. We can train the model such that each cognitive module activates only when relevant (e.g. numeric module fires only on number-heavy inputs, planning module engages when a multi-step query is detected). Because Mamba does not rely on pairwise token attention, it can scale this selective processing gracefully; the modules’ signals become just another part of the state update rather than additional attention overhead. Concretely, the architecture might look like: *Input tokens* → **Mamba layers** (SSM + integrated modules) → *Output*. Inside each Mamba layer, alongside the usual SSM computation, we insert hooks for modules: for example, after the SSM processes the token, we feed the hidden state into a small **Bayesian updater** component which outputs an adjusted state (this could be a one-layer network encoding a Bayes update step). The state then moves on. Likewise, a **Confidence head** can be attached at the output of the final layer to produce a confidence score for the sequence’s output; during training this can be supervised with calibration data. Mamba’s strength is that even with these additions, it remains **memory-efficient and fast for long sequences** (linear scaling) ([Mamba Explained](https://thegradient.pub/mamba-explained/#:~:text=bottleneck%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20Attention%20Mechanism,5x%20faster%20than%20Transformer%20fast%E2%80%9D1)) ([Mamba Explained](https://thegradient.pub/mamba-explained/#:~:text=Mamba%20enjoys%20fast%20inference%20and,in%20pretraining%20and%20downstream%20evaluation)). This means we can allow the model to think in more steps or maintain more internal context (like a lengthy chain-of-thought or a large knowledge base) without incurring prohibitive costs. In essence, Mamba serves as the *neural “brain”* in our design – a flexible state-based processor in which our cognitive modules are plug-in circuits enhancing its capabilities.

**BitNet Efficiency Layer:** BitNet is an extremely efficient transformer variant that uses **1-bit weights** in its linear layers, drastically reducing model size and computation without significant loss in performance ([[2310.11453] BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453#:~:text=deployment%20and%20raised%20concerns%20about,precision%20Transformers)). In BitNet, each weight is basically a single binary parameter (with techniques to retain stability and accuracy), and it achieves performance on par with standard transformers while cutting memory and energy use by ~85–96% ([[2310.11453] BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453#:~:text=deployment%20and%20raised%20concerns%20about,precision%20Transformers)) ([[2310.11453] BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453#:~:text=substantially%20reducing%20memory%20footprint%20and,to%20even%20larger%20language%20models)). We incorporate BitNet techniques to ensure our avian-inspired architecture can run at scale and be accessible to the open-source community. Specifically, after designing the modules in a high-level architecture (as described with Mamba), we apply **BitNet’s quantization approach**: replace standard dense layers and matrix multiplies with *BitLinear* layers (BitNet’s 1-bit weight matrices) ([[2310.11453] BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453#:~:text=deployment%20and%20raised%20concerns%20about,precision%20Transformers)). The modules themselves (confidence head, Bayesian updater, etc.) can also be quantized or kept at slightly higher precision if needed for stability – but since these modules are relatively small (compared to the full model), even keeping them at (for example) 8-bit won’t add much overhead. The result is a model that is both **cognitively enhanced and computationally lightweight**. We envision an open-source implementation where researchers can train a reasonably sized model (billions of parameters) with these modules on accessible hardware, thanks to BitNet’s efficiency gains. For instance, BitNet enables large models to run on CPU-only environments with speed-ups, by exploiting bit-level operations ([Microsoft's “1‑bit” AI model runs on a CPU only, while ... - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/microsoft-researchers-create-super%E2%80%91efficient-ai-that-uses-up-to-96-less-energy/#:~:text=Microsoft%27s%20%E2%80%9C1%E2%80%91bit%E2%80%9D%20AI%20model%20runs,precision%20models)) ([Microsoft's “1‑bit” AI model runs on a CPU only, while ... - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/microsoft-researchers-create-super%E2%80%91efficient-ai-that-uses-up-to-96-less-energy/#:~:text=Those%20efficiency%20improvements%20mean%20BitNet,precision%20models)). This means the advanced reasoning modules (which might require multiple reasoning passes or maintenance of large state) become feasible to use in practice without needing a supercomputer. BitNet essentially serves as the *engineering optimization* layer of our blueprint – ensuring that all the fancy cognitive modules don’t make the model too slow or too memory-hungry. By combining BitNet’s quantized transformer framework with Mamba’s state-space paradigm, we aim to get the best of both: the **ability to handle complex, long-horizon tasks (via Mamba)** with the **efficiency to scale and deploy widely (via BitNet)**.

**Integration and Control Flow:** Bringing it together, the architecture functions roughly as follows during a task: 

1. **Encoding & Core Processing:** An input (e.g. a question or scenario) is tokenized and fed into the Mamba/BitNet layers. The model processes the sequence, maintaining a hidden state. This hidden state is augmented with module-specific sub-states (for beliefs, plans, etc.) as described. Each layer’s computation is a blend of standard sequence modeling and module operations. For example, one layer might update the belief state if new evidence is found in the input (simulating a Bayesian update), while another layer might detect that the question requires multi-step reasoning and initiate a planning routine (writing an initial plan to the scratchpad part of the state).

2. **Module Activations:** The model’s design includes gating mechanisms so that modules activate only when beneficial. For instance, a **decision network** (which could be a learned classifier on the hidden state) might identify that the current token or query likely needs the planning module, and set a flag in the state. The subsequent layers see this flag and route the processing through the planning module (similar to a conditional computation or mixture-of-experts approach). If the flag is off, those computations can be skipped to save time – ensuring efficiency. This selective activation is analogous to animals engaging higher reasoning only when a problem isn’t solvable by instinct or simple habit.

3. **Intermediate Reasoning (if needed):** If a complex plan or tool use is required, the model can iterate internally. One way is using **recurrence** – since Mamba is naturally recurrent, it can loop over a segment of the state that represents the “plan” until a stopping condition is met (perhaps determined by the confidence module or a plan-completion signal). Alternatively, the model could output a draft answer or plan and then re-encode it as input (in a few-shot prompting style) to refine its reasoning – a process akin to self-reflection. Because our architecture handles long contexts, even multi-round self-querying is possible without exceeding context limits. Throughout this process, the *confidence module* monitors progress. If the model is iterating on a plan and not converging (low confidence in all interim answers), the confidence module might signal a halt to prevent infinite loops or suggest seeking external input (if such an option exists).

4. **Output Generation:** Finally, the model produces an answer or action sequence as output. Alongside the answer, it can output a confidence score (or a calibrated probability) indicating certainty, via the metacognition module. Downstream systems or users can use this to decide how much to trust the answer or whether to get a second opinion. The output stage might also include a **justification trace** – since the model has effectively done a chain-of-thought internally, we can configure it to output a summarized explanation or the key steps it took (this would be analogous to showing how it reached the answer, useful for transparency). The structured nature of our modules (especially the planning scratchpad and Bayesian state) can facilitate interpretability; e.g., the contents of the Bayesian belief vector could be decoded to natural language (“likely cause A: 70%, cause B: 30%”) as part of the output if desired, giving insight into the AI’s reasoning.

Throughout these stages, the use of **BitNet’s 1-bit transformations** ensures that even though we might be carrying a lot of state and doing complex operations, each operation is extremely cheap. The model’s matrices are mostly binary, and computations are optimized – effectively, we are trading off a bit of development complexity to gain *runtime efficiency*, which is crucial for scaling up. The entire architecture can be trained end-to-end, with multi-task objectives: e.g., standard language modeling or QA accuracy, plus auxilary losses for confidence calibration, planning correctness (if we have labeled reasoning steps), numeric accuracy on a math corpus, etc. Over time, the modules could also be fine-tuned separately on specialist data (for example, fine-tune the planning module on a dataset of plan-generation tasks) and then reintegrated – since we designed them to be modular.

To illustrate the blueprint, consider a concrete scenario: **“The AI is asked a riddle that requires logic, a calculation, and careful reasoning.”** The query enters the model. The **Bayesian module** might kick in to weigh different interpretations of the riddle, the **planning module** might outline steps (“Step 1: interpret meaning, Step 2: do calculation, Step 3: eliminate unlikely answers”), the **numeric module** handles the actual math in Step 2, and the **metacognition module** monitors if the riddle’s answer is obtained confidently. If the model is unsure, it could ask itself a clarification question or use a tool (if enabled). Finally, it outputs the riddle’s answer along with a high confidence score and perhaps an explanation of how it arrived there. All of this occurs within a single integrated architecture, thanks to the division of cognitive labor among specialized components.

## Neuromorphic Parallels and Future Directions (Speculative)  
While our design is intended for conventional digital AI models, it’s worth noting its parallels with **neuromorphic computing** – hardware and architectures inspired by the brain. Birds achieve their cognition with highly efficient neural circuitry; in the long term, one could imagine implementing our modules on neuromorphic chips to further approach brain-like efficiency. For example, a Bayesian inference module could be realized with spiking neural networks that naturally compute probabilities via spike rates, or a planning module could be an emergent oscillatory circuit that searches through solutions (some neuromorphic systems excel at optimization through dynamics). The **substrate-independence** evidenced by convergent evolution suggests we could map the same cognitive algorithm onto multiple substrates: software on GPUs, FPGAs, analog neural chips, or even optical processors. Early steps in this direction might involve using neuromorphic hardware (like Intel’s Loihi spiking chip) to implement a simplified version of one of our modules (say, a spiking confidence estimator that monitors a standard neural network’s output). Such hybrid systems – part standard AI, part neuromorphic – could potentially combine the strengths of both. Though this is not required for the blueprint to work (and current neuromorphic tech is still maturing), keeping an eye on brain-inspired hardware could eventually lead to **energy-efficient, real-time implementations** of avian-like cognition. The modular approach we outlined would allow swapping in specialized hardware for a module without redesigning the whole system (much like plugging in a coprocessor). This modular, neuromorphic-friendly perspective resonates with the spirit of our blueprint: multiple paths to intelligence, all arriving at similar functional capabilities.

## Conclusion  
Intelligence in nature provides a rich source of inspiration for AI design. The convergent evolution of cognitive skills in birds and mammals teaches us that **general intelligence can be achieved through different architectures, as long as certain key functionalities are present**. In birds, we identified those functionalities – probabilistic reasoning, metacognition, planning with tool use, numerical abstraction, etc. – and translated them into a modular blueprint for AI. By integrating these modules into advanced transformer-based models like Mamba and BitNet, we sketch a practical path toward AI systems that are not only powerful, but *aware of their own knowledge limits*, capable of *statistical inference*, and able to *plan multi-step solutions in a tool-augmented fashion*. The use of Mamba provides the capacity for long-horizon and flexible sequencing, while BitNet ensures the design remains efficient and scalable for the community. The result is a speculative yet concrete architecture that pushes transformer models closer to **artificial general intelligence** in a controlled, interpretable way – building on the lessons nature learned through millions of years of evolution. We emphasize that each module can be developed and tested in isolation (e.g., add a confidence head to an existing model and evaluate its calibration; add a planning routine and evaluate on complex reasoning benchmarks) and then progressively integrated. This modular, open-source approach will allow researchers to iteratively refine each cognitive component. The journey to human-level AI may well require rethinking our architectures; by looking to our feathered friends who independently mastered intelligence, we gain a roadmap of *what abilities to prioritize*. This blueprint is a step in that direction, proposing how we might engineer those abilities into today’s AI – **turning convergent evolution insights into convergent design principles** for advanced artificial minds.
