Building a Deterministic Code Agent: A Guide to Logic-Driven AutomationIn the rush to build increasingly autonomous AI agents, we often overlook a critical need: predictability. While generative models are powerful, their inferential nature can be a liability in workflows that demand precision, security, and auditability. What if you need an agent that executes tasks exactly as specified, without creative interpretation or deviation?This guide outlines the architecture for a deterministic code agent—a system that does what is asked, logs everything, and finishes only its required tasks. We'll replace the ambiguous "reasoning" of a typical LLM with the formal logic of Prolog and the constrained power of LMQL to create an agent that is both capable and completely transparent.The Core Philosophy: No Uncontrolled InferenceThe fundamental principle of this agent is the elimination of uncontrolled inference. The agent will not "decide" what to do in an open-ended way. Every action it takes must be the result of a logical deduction based on a strict set of rules.This system is built on three pillars:Logic-Based Task Execution: A Prolog engine serves as the agent's "brain," defining what it can and cannot do.Constrained, Verifiable Generation: LMQL is used not for creative writing, but for highly structured text transformations, ensuring outputs conform to precise formats.Comprehensive Context Logging: Every piece of data, every logical step, and every action is meticulously recorded, creating a complete and auditable trail of execution.Component 1: The Prolog Logic EngineInstead of an LLM, the core of our agent's decision-making is a Prolog knowledge base. Prolog is a logic programming language where we define facts and rules. The agent can only perform actions that are provably logical according to this knowledge base.How it Works:Define Capabilities as Facts: First, we define the agent's tools and capabilities as simple facts.% --- Agent Capabilities ---
can_execute(shell_command).
can_execute(file_io).
can_write(python).
can_write(json).
Define Task Execution as Rules: Next, we create rules that govern how these capabilities can be combined to accomplish tasks. A task is only valid if it can be satisfied by a rule.% --- Task Rules ---

% Rule: To create a python file, the agent must be allowed to perform
% file_io and be allowed to write python code.
can_perform_task(create_python_file(FileName, Content)) :-
    can_execute(file_io),
    can_write(python),
    is_valid_filename(FileName),
    is_safe_content(Content).

% Rule: To install dependencies, the agent must be allowed to execute
% shell commands and the command must be a 'pip install'.
can_perform_task(install_dependencies(Package)) :-
    can_execute(shell_command),
    is_pip_install_command(Package).
When the agent receives a request, it's converted into a query to the Prolog engine (e.g., can_perform_task(create_python_file('app.py', '...'))). If the query succeeds, the agent gets a logical green light. If it fails, the action is forbidden. There is no ambiguity.Component 2: The LMQL Constrained GeneratorWhile Prolog handles the "what," LMQL (Language Model Query Language) handles the "how" for content generation. We use an LLM not for reasoning, but as a highly advanced text-formatting tool. LMQL's power lies in its ability to force LLM output into a specific structure.How it Works:Imagine the agent needs to generate a JSON configuration file based on a list of requirements. Instead of just asking an LLM to "write some JSON," which might result in errors, we use a constrained LMQL query."Generate a JSON object with the following properties:
- 'database_url' which must be a valid postgresql URL.
- 'port' which must be an integer between 1024 and 65535.
- 'features' which is an array of strings containing at least 'logging' and 'auth'.

Here is the generated JSON:
```json
[JSON_OUTPUT]
"// LMQL constraintswherejson_mode(JSON_OUTPUT) andSTOPS_AT(JSON_OUTPUT, "}")
The `json_mode` constraint forces the `[JSON_OUTPUT]` variable to be syntactically perfect JSON. The LLM is not "inferring" the structure; it's filling in the blanks within a rigid template defined by our code. This makes it a deterministic and verifiable generation tool.

### Component 3: The Orchestrator and The Log

The **Orchestrator** is the central Python application that ties everything together. It manages the workflow and, most importantly, maintains a detailed, step-by-step log of its operations.

**The Execution Cycle:**

1.  **Task Ingestion:** The Orchestrator receives a user request (e.g., "Create a new Flask application with a single endpoint").
2.  **Context Gathering:** It gathers all relevant context. This isn't an inferential process; it's explicit. It might involve reading specific files the user pointed to or checking environment variables.
3.  **Logical Verification (Prolog Query):** The Orchestrator translates the user task into a series of queries for the Prolog engine.
    * *Query:* `can_perform_task(create_python_file('app.py', ...))`? -> *Result:* `True`.
    * *Query:* `can_perform_task(install_dependencies('flask'))`? -> *Result:* `True`.
4.  **Action Execution:** For each verified step, the Orchestrator executes the action.
    * If content needs to be generated, it calls the **LMQL Constrained Generator**.
    * If a file needs to be written, it interacts with the filesystem.
5.  **Meticulous Logging:** Every single one of these steps is written to an immutable log.

**The Log Entry:** A log entry is not just a timestamp and a message. It's a structured record of the agent's state and decisions.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:01Z",
  "step_id": "step_002",
  "task": "Install Dependencies",
  "context_used": [
    "system.python.version",
    "project.requirements_file_path"
  ],
  "logic_query": "can_perform_task(install_dependencies('flask'))",
  "logic_result": "True",
  "action_taken": {
    "type": "shell_command",
    "command": "pip install flask"
  },
  "action_output": "Successfully installed flask-2.3.3",
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
This log provides a complete audit trail. You can trace exactly why the agent took a specific action by looking at the logic_query and the context_used.ConclusionBy combining the logical rigor of Prolog with the constrained generation of LMQL, we can build a code agent that is powerful yet predictable. This architecture moves away from the "black box" nature of inferential AI, offering a transparent, auditable, and secure alternative for tasks that demand precision. It doesn't guess, it doesn't infer—it verifies the logic, executes the task, and logs the proof.
